# Phopy

A photo copy tool for my personal needs.

## Install

...

## Features

Phopy takes a directory as input and copies the files from that directory to a target directory with the following base conditions:

- Copy all RAW files
- Copy JPEG files when it does not have a correlated RAW file (case of HDR or other photgraphy where the camera does not create a RAW image)

## Configuration

You can pass phopy configuration directly into the command, some also support ENV variables if specified.
